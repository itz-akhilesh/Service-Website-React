## Approach

I started by planning the layout and wireframes for Home and Contact pages. Components were created for Header, Footer, Hero, Services, Testimonials, and Contact Form. I ensured the site was **fully responsive** and SEO-friendly. Finally, the project was built using Vite and deployed with SPA routing configured for both Netlify and Vercel.
